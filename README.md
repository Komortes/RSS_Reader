# Test project #

Implement simple RSS reader.

### Technologies ###
* ASP.NET MVC 5 + EF 6.0 or ASP.NET Core MVC + EF Core
* Code first DB models
* GIT for versioning

### Functional requirements ###
* Add RSS feed (url + name)
* List of all feeds
* Delete feed
* Detail of feed
 * List of all articles in the feed
 * Filter articles by date (from-to; use date picker of your choice)
 * Reload articles in feed
 
### Bonus functional requirements ###
* It's not necessary to implement this, but we'll be happy if you do one of these things :)
* Add checkbox for deleting feeds. Add button for checking all checkboxes.
* Search in feeds (by name) or in articles (by title).
 
### What is not necessary to implement ###
* Users, login etc. Everything will be public.
* Cron for reloading feeds. Simple button for reloading one feed will be ok.
* Detail of article. External link to the article will be enough.

### What we want to see ###
* Source code (in GIT) - Please create your own GIT repository on GitHub (or Bitbucket or somewhere else), commit the code there and send us the repository.
* If you can deploy the project somewhere, it will be nice (you can use free variant of Azure App service for example)
